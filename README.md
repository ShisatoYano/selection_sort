# selection_sort_sample

* Sorting by repeatedly finding the minimum element considering ascending order.  
* The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.  
1. The subarray which is already sorted.  
2. Remaining subarray which is unsorted.  
* In every iteration, the minimum element from the unsorted is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.
